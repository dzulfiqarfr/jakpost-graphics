# Code and data behind articles on The Jakarta Post

This repo contains the code and data to produce the analysis and visualizations for my articles on The Jakarta Post (JakPost). While JakPost did not have a data journalism desk when I worked there, I tried to pursue it myself with the business desk. Hence, the articles were mostly related to socioeconomic issues.

I organized this repo by year and then by project (or article). The project directories were stored in chronological order in terms of publication date on JakPost.

In each project directory, youâ€™ll find roughly four subdirectories, namely data, doc, src and result. The contents of each subdirectory are as follows:  
- data: data (both raw and cleaned) for analysis;  
- doc: documents, including PDFs that contain tables or technical notes on the analysis;  
- src: scripts to analyze the data and visualize the results; and  
- result: analysis results in CSVs and the visualizations in SVGs and PNGs.

I used a combination of R, Google Sheets, Tabula, Datawrapper and Inkscape to work on these articles. I collected the data from both official and private sources.

The code in this repo improves the original analysis and visualizations where necessary. So there are some differences in analysis results and visualizations between this repo and the published articles on JakPost. Find the details on the README of each project directory.
