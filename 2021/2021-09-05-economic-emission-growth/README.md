# Changelog

The GDP and emission per capita chart:
- removed Turkey and China from the chart. As an outlier, China could hide trends in other countries;  
- removed the line to annotate the signing of Paris Agreement because it was not really relevant and added clutter instead;  
- used a more concise text annotation;  
- moved the legend to the top of the chart; and  
- added minor visual improvements.

The HDI chart:  
- removed the shade to annotate the 1998 Asian financial crisis as it was not really relevant;  
- used a color legend instead of placing labels adjacent to the lines;  
- used a simpler axis break; and  
- added minor visual improvements.
