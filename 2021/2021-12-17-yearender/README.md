# Data

Data | Source |  
---- | ------ |  
COVID-19 cases and vaccination rate | [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) |  
Mobility | [Google](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) |  
Gross domestic product (GDP) growth | [Statistics Indonesia](https://bps.go.id/indicator/11/104/1/-seri-2010-laju-pertumbuhan-pdb-seri-2010.html) |  

I have filtered the mobility data for Indonesia and cleaned the column names. This allows me to commit the data to this repository, otherwise the raw data will be too big.


# Changelog

The chart:  
- added footnotes to explain the data was smoothed to seven-day moving average and the mobility was compared with normal levels in January-February 2020; and  
- added minor visual improvements.
